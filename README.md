# Screen Capture
Screen Capture is a set of Clarion classes and templates implemented as the plug-ins for the [Easy Edge (Chromium)](http://www.ingasoftplus.com/ProductDetail.php?ProductID=304) template.  
These templates let the user select a screen or portion of a screen (such as a window) to capture as a media stream. This stream can then be recorded (Screen Recorder template) or shared with others over the network (Screen Sharing template).
